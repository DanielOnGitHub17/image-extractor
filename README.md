# Python Web Image Extractor
This Python project extracts images from a website url
- It can access many image formats including SVG.
- It works using only Python Standard Library modules.

## Usage
- Run the main.py file.
- A tkinter window should pop up providing a textbox.
- Enter the URL into the textbox and click "Get Images"
- When it is done, click the download button to download the images
- Select the folder you want to store the images
- Wait for the images from the website to download
- When the images download, the folder is automatically opened for you to view the images.

The application might not work for some websites.\
Also, it might appear glitchy sometimes, but it probably just encountered a loop of complex tasks.

Enjoy using it.
